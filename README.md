## Explain
### Introduction
People who commute throughout the area provide inspiration for the project. Whether people are passing by or interacting with the establishment, they are contributing to its profitability. In other words, a location that is unmaintained or has low profit because of poor locationâ€”it may be in a blind area or fall between low-density zones. Even if it might be profitable, which would increase its value, a location with low or unworthy space for rent could have an impact on the area as a whole. Therefore, the place's administration must retain people there within reason as possible and establish an attraction, which may be challenging without indications. The goal was to provide management support by using cameras (video) for processing and collecting statistics, allowing more persuasion to measure and visualize plenty more straightforwardly.
### Process and Visualize
Identifying persons that visit the location throughout the day in order to gather videos and send them for processing. lack of a camera within, these rate data could be utilized for area analysis, computation, and collection. It could be preserved for subsequent use in visualization after processing. The visualization, which resembles a heat map with an outline boundary, colors and diagrams the area using data that has been analyzed.
